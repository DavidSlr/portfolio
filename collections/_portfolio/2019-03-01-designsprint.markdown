A big German enterprise approached us because they needed a solution to manage and provide access to the vast amount of diverse business inteligence resources that are built internally. We got invited to a four-day event where we could work through a design sprint and showing a first draft of what a solution could look like.

The goal of this design sprint was to give us insights into the company context and problem details while observing our UX approach and letting us compete against other invited teams for the following project.

## Project Takeaways

- Running a four day design sprint can be a very effective way to get a kickstart with a problem space. It yields very fast results that might not be optimal but will certainly create a better understanding. From here you can test and iterate.
- A good portion of the available time is not spend ideating and designing. It can be scary to push what feels like the core work of a project so far back. But trusting the process and taking the time to define and work with problem never failed me.
