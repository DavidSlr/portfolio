##Design Process

* I __interviewed__ users about their favorite apps, enjoyable app features/designs/aspects, perceived emotions. This was supported with simple selfmade emotion cards. Those helped the user to select and talk about emotions.
* A minimal valuable product (MVP) was __sketched__ that provides the basic functionality for the app concept.
* Two __design workshops__ were held with design students to get a more diverse set of ideas on how to design for emotions.
* Quick __sketches__ of workshop ideas were created.
* The MVP was __implemented__ and delivered to test users a Windows Store closed beta release.
* The enhanced version was __implemented__ as an update for the MVP.
* __Hallway usability tesing__ was done to find and fix rough usability issues.
* Test users were __interviewed__ about their experience after two weeks of testing.

##Project Takeaways

* Targeting specific emotions can help to make an app more meaningful to the user and provide additional motivation to use it.
* Emotional design can only work if basic requirements on usability and user satisfaction are met first.
* Interviews revealed that there were some usability issues in the final prototype. Another iteration would have improved the user experience and enabled some of the emotional design aspects to strengthen their impact.
