tagline: Tablet banking app mockup for graphical interfaces course
shortdesc: This banking app was created for the graphical interfaces course of my master. Our group worked on the concept and wireframes together. Later everybody worked on a visual design individually.

context: Graphical Interfaces course, semester 1 of Interaction Design & Methodologies Master

duration: ~2 days group work, 4 days invidual redesign

used_skills: Sketching, Wireframing (Axure RP Pro 6.5), Photoshop CS6

division_of_work: The first stage was executed in a group of four. All of us made sketches and wireframes and two group members later made the first rough Photoshop mockup. In the redesign stage I worked on the high fidelity mockups in Photoshop on my own.

In this project of the Graphical Interfaces course we should design an online banking tablet app for the Sekerbank. The resolution 1024x768 (4:3) was part of the brief. We worked in a group of four to work on the concept and layout as well as create sketches and wireframes. Then a first mockup of the design was created.
For the second phase we got feedback for our group work and did a redesign individually. I kept the layout but made the high fidelity mockup from scratch. This was the first time using Photoshop for a non-trivial task and I used the opportunity to learn a lot from it. The design however is intenionally simple. I aimed for a flat design without shadows and gradients.
