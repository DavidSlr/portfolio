[GOTRIS][gotris] is a project to develop a river information system for the [Göta älv][gota-alv-wikipedia]. In the course Information Visualization we got the task to develop a tablet app to provide the needed information for pilots. Those pilots accompany ships on their way on the Göta älv. There are several facilities like watergates and bridges as well as other vessels on the river that need to coordinate their interactions. The pilot will support the crew with these interactions and the timeplan. The tablet app is supposed to display the required information for these tasks in an accesible form.

This project was an opportunity to work some more with Photoshop. I also used Illustrator for the first time to create icons.
