Me and a group of friends got a cajón as a birthday present for another friend. I made a stencil of us and sprayed it on the cajón. First I took photos and prepared them in Photoshop to be printed as a template for the stencil, then cut the template out from cardboard and used spray paint to get the image on to the cajón.

"Club der Denker" is a reference to Scrubs (although in German). Did somebody recognize that?
